		<strong>Hello there!</strong><br/>
		My name is David Moyer. I am currently a student in Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC).
		I'm a pretty friendly person, and am very interested in anything that has something to do with technology. 
		I myself enjoy playing and creating games, and know some C#, along with being well-versed in JavaScript. 
		I have also taken a course in basic C++.<br/>
		A few skills of mine would fall into Problem Solving, Time Management, and Communication. Good skills 
		to have when securing a job. I may be a bit shy but it doesn't take long for me to warm up to people.
		Feel free to contact me if you'd ever like me in your work place!

	<p>
		<strong>Goals</strong><br/>
		Some goals and plans for the future are to hopefully obtain an additional secondary education 
		certificate, and to secure a career in video game design. In the long run, hopefully obtaining a 
		position at a very popular gaming company.
