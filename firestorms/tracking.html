	<p>
		Not much can be done to predict a firestorm ahead of time, but you can predict what
		wildfires may become massive firestorms depending on it's shape.<br/><br/>Wildfires that
		burn in expansive areas of active flames are more likely to form into a massive
		firestorm, while fires that burn in a narrow expanse most likely will not.<br/><br/>
		Wildfires can be ranked from 1-6 depending on it's visuals, and this would most likely
		be how firestorms are recorded.
