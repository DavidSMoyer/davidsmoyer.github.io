			<p class="no-border slide-text">
				In British Columbia, August 12, 2017, a massive wildfire
				outbreak occurred. The massive wildfire had created it's own
				storm system, being classified as a "pyroCbs," or a Firestorm.<br/><br/>
				In the end the firestorm consumed 4 700 square miles of British 
				Columbia. Five total Firestorms had formed, the resulting smoke
				being detected almost as far as the North Pole. This was named
				the "Mother of all pyroCbs," dealing over 127 million dollars in
				damage.

			<p class="no-border slide-text">
				A wildfire fighting in progress on November 23, 2016, a few days after
				the wildfire evolved. Humidity dropped and strong winds moved over in the
				period of a day. The massive plume of smoke and winds stopped helicopters
				from engaging. Winds from 40-50mph with gusts of 87mph flooded the area.<br/><br/>
				No structures in the park were damaged directly, but the wind did do minor damage. 17 000
				acres were burned.

			<img src="images/spokane.jpg" alt="Someone's house engulfed in flames in Spokane." width="500" height="500" />
			<p class="no-border slide-text">
				In 1991, a massive firestorm rocked Spokane.
				After forty-two days without rain or much weather of any kind, 
				50 mph winds rushed into the area. Later, smoke from a nearby 
				fire invaded the weather office.<br/><br/>
				When the day ended 80 wildfires had ravaged the land. 112 homes were destroyed,
				two people were killed, and 50 000 acres were scorched. Some of the fires still
				burned out of control.
